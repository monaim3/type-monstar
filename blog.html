                      <p class="card-text">localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage, the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data. This tutorial features localStorage, but the syntax for sessionStorage is the same.
                        With this knowledge, you can now create, read, and update key/value pairs in localStorage.</p>

                    </h5>
                      <p class="card-text">e often identify those scopes as local scopes and identify the top-level scope as the global scope. In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node.js, it’s controlled by the global object.

                        It’s hard to completely avoid the global scope, unless you’re coding purely functional style, but you should minimize the use of any global variables because they represent a state and having that defined globally makes it more vulnerable to conflicts and data corruption. You should use an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - when you can - to wrap all your JavaScript code in a local function scope (in Node.js, this is actually done automatically for every module, so you don’t have to do it there):</p>
